# React-Backend-Benchmarks

This project was for me to experiment with the query speeds of RESTful API's that were built with three different
programming languages: JavaScript, Python, and Go. A React frontend is connected to all three backends to serve as a
common entry point for making requests.

Users of the application would be able to run iterations of a specific query using a particular language. The results of
the runs are displayed in the accordion on the frontend.

I utilized the Microsoft Northwinds database to run queries on. The SQL file is provided.
